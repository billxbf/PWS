"Gary manages two Amazon distribution centers. The first center processes 10000 packages per day, and the second center processes three times that volume. If Amazon makes 5 cents of profit per package, how much profit per week do the two centers make combined?","First find how many packages the second center processes per day: 10000 packages/day * 3 = <<10000*3=30000>>30000 packages/day
Then add the packages the first center processes: 30000 packages/day + 10000 packages/day = <<30000+10000=40000>>40000 packages/day
Then multiply the number of packages by Amazon's profit per package to find Amazon's daily profit: 40000 packages/day * $0.05/package = $2000/day
Then multiply the daily profits by the number of days in a week to find the weekly profits: $2000/day * 7 days/week = $<<2000*7=14000>>14000/week

"A family is going to the amusement park. The adult tickets cost $22 for admission, and the tickets for children cost $7. The family consists of 2 adults and 2 children. What is the total price the family will pay for admission?","To solve this problem you can set up an equation to represent the total price the family will pay, with a representing the number of adult tickets, c representing the number of childrenâ€™s tickets, and p representing the total price of admission.
Thus 22a + 7c = p
