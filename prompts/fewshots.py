HOTPOTQA_COT = '''What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into?
Step 1: Identify the eastern sector of the Colorado Orogeny
The Colorado Orogeny refers to a series of mountain-building events that occurred in the Rocky Mountains, primarily in the present-day U.S. state of Colorado. The eastern sector of the Colorado Orogeny likely refers to the easternmost part of this mountain range, which includes the Front Range, Wet Mountains, and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains.
Step 2: Determine the elevation range of the eastern sector
The Front Range, Wet Mountains, and Sangre de Cristo Mountains have varying elevations. The Front Range has elevations ranging from around 5,000 feet to over 14,000 feet (1,500 meters to 4,300 meters). The Wet Mountains have elevations ranging from about 6,000 feet to over 12,000 feet (1,800 meters to 3,700 meters). The Sangre de Cristo Mountains have elevations ranging from approximately 7,000 feet to over 14,000 feet (2,100 meters to 4,300 meters).
Step 3: Combine the elevation ranges
Considering the elevation ranges of the three mountain ranges in the eastern sector of the Colorado Orogeny, the overall elevation range for the area extends from around 5,000 feet (1,500 meters) to over 14,000 feet (4,300 meters).
Answer: 5,000 feet to 4,000 feet

GSM8K_COT = '''Thomas, Toby, and Rebecca worked a total of 157 hours in one week.  Thomas worked x hours.  Toby worked 10 hours less than twice what Thomas worked, and Rebecca worked 8 hours less than Toby.  How many hours did Rebecca work?
Step 1: Translate the problem into algebraic expressions.
Thomas = x
Toby = 2x - 10
Rebecca = (2X - 10) - 8
Step 2: Use the total hours worked in a week to set up an equation.
Total hours worked = 157
x + (2x - 10) + ((2x - 10) - 8) = 157
Step 3: Solve the equation.
x + 2x - 10 + 2x - 10 - 8 = 157
5x - 28 = 157
5x = 185
x = 37
Step 4: Find the number of hours Rebecca worked.
Rebecca = (2x - 10) - 8
Rebecca = (2 * 37 - 10) - 8
Rebecca = 74 - 10 - 8
Rebecca = 56

Two of the primary methods for identifying rocks in the laboratory are through optical microscopy and by using an electron microprobe . In an optical mineralogy analysis , thin sections of rock samples are analyzed through a petrographic microscope , where the minerals can be identified through their different properties in plane - polarized and cross - polarized light , including their birefringence , pleochroism , twinning , and interference properties with a conoscopic lens . In the electron microprobe , individual locations are analyzed for their exact chemical compositions and variation in composition within individual crystals .
